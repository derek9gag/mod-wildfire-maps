# Known issues

## Gameplay differences

- Unlike in Wildfire, civilians are indifferent even if you rob them
- Some civilians outside of San Mona are in Kingpin's faction. For example,
  some civilians in Drassen may attack if Kingpin has turned hostile.

## Issues due to map differences

- Departing Mercs leave their equipment in an open tile
- Equipment of captured mercs is placed in the open
- Squad may get stuck after using the "Travel to surface" function from deep
  underground. In that case, traverse out and back in the sector in stratigic map.
