## What is this about?

This is a modpack for JA2 Stracciatella, which lets you play on Wildfire maps with vanilla gameplay. You need to own both vanilla JA2 and JA2 Wildfire.


## What is this not?

It only include the maps. Everything else such as the new mercs, new weapons, new up-sized interface, new sound FX, are not included.


## How do I install the mod?

1. Install JA2-Stracciatella over JA2 vanilla

2. Download a release package and extract it under the mods directory of Stracciatella

3. Run install_wildfire_maps. It should ask you for the source directory. Select the Wildfire data directory.

   Alteratively, use the command line arg --src_dir. See --help for available options.

4. Run the JA2-Stracciatella launcher. In the "Data" tab, add "wildfire-maps" to the enabled mods


## What else do I need to know?

- Sectors are much denser now. Towns sectors have more buildings and the buildings appear much more functional than vanilla

- Facilities are much more heavily fortified. You are warned.

- This mod has only been tested with Steam version of Wildfire (6.04). If you encounter any problems, please report on GitHub.
