## What is this about?

This is a modpack for JA2 Stracciatella, which lets you play on Wildfire maps with vanilla gameplay.


## What is this not?

Wildfire also introduced new mercs, new weapons, new up-sized interface, new sound FX, etc. None of those are included in this mod.


## How do I install the mod?

1. Install JA2-Stracciatella over JA2 vanilla

2. Download a release package and extract it under the mods directory of Stracciatella

3. Copy the below SLF files from Wildfire into the mod directory (mods/wildfire-maps/Data/)
    - BinaryData.slf
    - InterFace.slf
    - Maps.slf
    - NPCData.slf
    - RadarMaps.slf
    - TileSets.slf

4. Run install_wildfire_maps

5. Run the JA2-Stracciatella launcher. In the "Data" tab, add "wildfire-maps" to the enabled mods


## What else do I need to know?

- Sectors are much denser now. Towns sectors have more buildings and the buildings appear much more functional than vanilla

- Facilities are much more heavily fortified. You are warned.

- This mod has only been tested with Steam version of Wildfire (6.04). If you encounter any problems, please report on GitHub.
