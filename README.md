## What is this about?

This is a modpack for JA2 Stracciatella, which lets you play on Wildfire maps
with vanilla gameplay. You need to own **both vanilla JA2 and JA2 Wildfire**.


## What is this not?

It only include the maps. Everything else such as the new mercs, new weapons,
new up-sized interface, new sound FX, are not included.

Be sure to read [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the list of currently
unsupported Wildfire features.


## How do I install the mod?

1. Install JA2-Stracciatella over JA2 vanilla

2. Download a [release package](https://github.com/ja2-stracciatella/mod-wildfire-maps/releases)
and extract it under the `mods` directory of Stracciatella

3. Run `install_wildfire_maps`. It should ask you for the source directory.
Select the Wildfire data directory.

Alteratively, use the command line argument `--src_dir` to pass the path
directly. See `--help` for available options.

4. Run the JA2-Stracciatella launcher. In the "Data" tab, add "wildfire-maps"
to the enabled mods list.

Alternatively pass `-mod wildfire-maps` when launching stracciatella directly.


## What else do I need to know?

- Sectors are much denser now. Towns sectors have more buildings and the
buildings appear much more functional than vanilla

- Facilities are much more heavily fortified. You have been warned.

- This mod has only been tested with the Steam version of Wildfire (6.04).

- If you encounter any problems, please report them on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ja2-stracciatella/mod-wildfire-maps/issues).
